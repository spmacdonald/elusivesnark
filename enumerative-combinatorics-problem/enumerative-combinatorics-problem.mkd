An Enumerative Combinatorics Problem
2008-11-02
This post is about a problem I have been working on in my spare time for the past few months. One of my favorite aspects of this problem is that it can be stated in a straightforward way and still yields some pretty interesting, complex behavior. I initially started working on this as a way to learn more about the python programming language, but the real meat here lies in the combinatorial proofs which I am still trying to work out.
